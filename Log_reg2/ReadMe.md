While following along a tutorial on https://realpython.com/logistic-regression-python/ I came across a section of the article that performed standardiztion on the handwriting recognition dataset. The major reason seemed to be bringing all the different parameters upto scale, which could help the model accuracy. I decided to test that out for myself, building a standardized as well as non standardized model, and it seems the non standardized model outperforms the standardized one. It's still not exactly clear to me when exactly the need for standardization comes in, hopefully the fog will dispel upon further research.
